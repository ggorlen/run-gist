# run-gist

Run a GitHub gist.

### TODO

- pull down JS/CSS files in repo
  - if there is no HTML file, but there is a JS file, run it and show output.
  - render markdown with marked
  - render JSON
  - otherwise just show the text (preformatted?)
- maybe add a feature to list all gists for a user and let them click one to open/exec it.
- options to open in new window or replace current, optionally keep run gist header bar
